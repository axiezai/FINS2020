This repository includes contents for my talk at WCM's virtual FINS on Tuesday Oct. 13th, 2020. 

Material are gathered from the following papers:
 - [Spectral graph theory of brain oscillations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24991)
 - [Emergence of canonical functional networks from complex-valued Laplacian of structural connnectome](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.300384v1)

The open source repository for the spectral graph model is located at: [https://github.com/Raj-Lab-UCSF/spectrome](https://github.com/Raj-Lab-UCSF/spectrome)
